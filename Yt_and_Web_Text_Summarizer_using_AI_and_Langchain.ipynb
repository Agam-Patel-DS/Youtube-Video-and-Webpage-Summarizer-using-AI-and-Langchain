page_content=\"go Gir [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] y m Gana [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] Krishna Krishna Krishna Krishna h h h [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Krishna Krishna [Applause] H MRA jagat balad subadra Maharani Kang bhat so you can take the verse 2.3.4 oh [Music] [Music] Krishna [Music] Nam [Music] H Krishna H Krishna Krishna Krishna h h h h h om om [Music] [Music] [Music] Kumar It's Not Duplicate it's not going or you can take in your own mobile otherwise H lose contact [Applause] [Music] t [Music] har proes [Music] [Music] Together Al together please [Music] [Applause] yeah thank you transl by divine grace certainly that heart is still framed which in spite of once chanting the holy name of the Lord with concentration does not change even when one displays such signs of transformation has tears in the eyes an ecstatic standing of the hairs on and he saying so the will only read one section of this purport yeah here Papa saying you can see from this point the whole process of spiritual culture is aimed at changing the heart of the living being in the matter of his eternal relation with the Supreme Lord as a subordinate servant which is his eternal Constitution position that means when when we take to spiritual life over 1 2 3 4 years we should start recognizing that I'm actually a insignificant servant of Krishna and God is great I am small so so with the progress of devotion service the reaction of change in the Heart Is exhibited by gradual Detachment from the sense of material enjoyment by a false sense of loing over loing it over the world and an increase in the attitude of rendering loving service to the Lord which means the B goes far away and Sati increases in a devote so B is foram Janam you know one wants to gain lot of wealth and then show to others that I am richer than you or one wants to gain more followers and say that I have more following than you or one wants to attract a woman and become her master and expect that she will serve me and give me Comfort so in this way or one wants to be popular amongst many women so this kind of attractions or propensity for S gratification so he's saying that when we chant the Holy Name gradually we understand Krishna is the enjoyer I am the enjoyed his proprietor he predominator I'm predominated he is the master I servant so and that kind of understanding is supposed to come say for example a cricket bat is meant for you know batting and a spoon is meant for eating J somebody says I will use the spoon and play GG is it possible yeah possible if you try to hit a COR ball with a spoon your hand will go like this then you have to go to doctor you know there may be a fracture or something or if somebody takes a criet bat and applies ficol and touches G and tries to put in the mouth we will break our tooth because the Constitutional position of a cricket bat is meant for playing Cricket constition position of the spoon is forting they can't do the opposite work similarly when the living enery tries to imitate the Supreme Lord he looks like a fool because that is not our nature so actually we have to start rejoicing in being servant it's called daskam and come in the just like a child sits in the lap of the mother or father comfortably and very jolly isn't it you seen that they feel very comfortable because they know mother or father is my main protector and the child is very happy in the lab so in the same manner we will be very happy if we joyfully accept the reality that Krishna is the master I his servant says in a gold ring sometimes they have a blue diamond studded H looks very attractive the combination of the gold and the blue uh shining diamond you know Pearl type of thing on the top but if you remove that blue thing I mean the diamond then you find the gold ring there's a depression similarly blue Krishna is is there in the heart of everybody when we carry him in our heart we are very happy if you take him out of our heart just like told go far away I don't want you then we get depression just like there's depression in a ring we have depression in our heart by removing God from our life so therefore intelligent Souls welcome the Lord Into the Heart Krishna you be my master accept me as your servant engage me in your service so voluntarily accepting this true position we can truly be very happy even in this worldish so this this is the reason why we are all trying to chant AR Krishna read prad books come to Temple after a few years we have to come to grip with this reality what I'm telling you just now instead of putting myself in the center I had to put Krishna in the center then uh then we'll be truly happy and then Papa talks about vti he says here V bti regulated devotional service but the limbs of the body Nam the Eyes Ears Nose hands legs as explained before is now stressed here in in relation to the mind which is the impetus for all the activities of the limbs of the the body it is expected by all means that by discharging regulated devotional service one must manifest the change of heart so the change of heart should come when I practicing sad this is the acid test for us huh like for example cruel marari became compassionate marari you agree he had a change of heart correct now arant rahugana became humble rahugana subsequently he show a change crying Arjuna became courageous Arjuna and then he fought the Battle so there was a change of heart you know prad came as a Desh premy and then went back from his Guru as a Krishna premy isn't it in one meeting only decided to accept his mission and propagate it all over the world although he was a gandhian before huh so that type of change of heart should happen V preaches strongly to the rra attacked to the rra became detached to the correct similarly aam heard the sermons by vishas you know's heart became filled with love for God by chanting the holy name for 12 years in the harid so this is a change of heart so we all have to check when I came to Krishna Consciousness many years ago what was the state of my heart climate of my heart and what is the climate of my heart now so you will see traditionally the vnas are those who Delight in chanting the holy names and remembering the Lord while chanting the names like I will sing one song which we used to sing when you go to B Madam we sing [Music] [Music] prra [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] so this is one still imprinted in my mind they used to sing like this every land they sing some new word isn't similarly similar they would sing there's one more then they would sing another step you know to play this one so um [Music] [Music] go [Music] M see these names are why are they kept we should know the meaning of the names also say he's saying radika manohara means the one who steals the heart of radika who is that Krishna whose name is man radik man his name is and who what is his nature he is very fond of his devotees andala how do you know his B you can see how he deals with nand how he deals with he's carrying the sandals of nand on his head so actually devote means for them this is the food sing the different names of the Lord and meditate on the meaning of those names and those names produce the forms of what Krishna does how he looks like what are qualities what are his past times so uh if we give up the B then we will rejoice in this type of glorification of the Lord I remember when very very early days in 19 9192 used to go us to us to sing the song in [Applause] kishish kishna [Applause] kishna so this is the common line and then they will sing about raan his quality and then again we will sing this one again krishna's quality you sing and then again you sing this so in this way Krishna is a hero and R is a heroin and we are their fans and and they perform Lea and we clap hands but unfortunately living in says I will perform God should Clap Hands many people come to Temple thinking that God will favor My Romance and they're shocked to see God himself has his romance they wondering God has a spiritual romance his love is pure love and his love is based on the Saab b as we told before his love is based on the attraction of service principle this is what I was speaking in the other Temple this is a very important thing to understand in this world the Love Is Love what goes on in the Name of Love Is Nothing But lust exploitative mentality like what Shaka came with lust and ra ra looked at with lust so they wanted to exploit and enjoy but in the the biti one is very eag see look at the fruit wer lady she came with the heart to give to Krishna that is love brah is going to Daka to give to Krishna that is love yes propa says is not asking give me my daily bread she's saying better come here take bread and butter she feeding is you know bread giving religion not bread asking religion so love means to give lust means to grab so when we have the grabbing mode grabbing culture we suffer when we have a giving culture without any expectation like a mother's love for a child very pure so therefore we all we have to experience the change of heart but aaras are so kind they have written so many vnav songs they have given so many nice commentaries they have given us the ARA to worship they have given us the Holy Name they have given us nice Prasad they have given us the form of the temple Ambience so that we can accept and also they have Meed out various ways to engage us just now we went to Haram you can go for Haram outdoor you can go for Prasad distribution book distribution rraam yesterday was such a beautiful Festival here isn't it such decoration amazing decoration here so everybody's hands legs can be engaged very well the senses of of the body and the purpose of engaging the senses is by this senses get purified by engaging kishna service mind gets purified by chanting intelligence gets purified by study of scriptures and Awakening via buddhi ego gets purified by humbling ourselves to devotees and not maintaining our arrogance so in this way that prop says the change of heart must happen he says if there is no such change the heart must be considered Ste framed for it is not melted even when there is chanting of the Holy Name Of The Lord we must always remember that hearing and chanting are the basic principles of discharging devotional duties and if they are properly performed there will follow the reactional Ecstasy with signs of Tears in the eyes and standing of the hairs on the body so when we become innocent duties pure hearted the purer we become this signs will manifest so if somebody's saying that I also get tears when I hear some vishna songs but we have to check whether we also get tears in other time because some people are emotional in nature they cry for everything and it is not acceptable yeah so they become emotional materially also so this therefore this tear should be accompanied by nine qualities mentioned by Swami in devotion all these things so these are all b symptoms nine symptoms so you can check with this verse whenever you want to test yourself put this nine qualities and check whether they match with you so these are natural consequences and are the preliminary symptoms of the Bava stage which are occurs before one reaches to the perfectional stage of prar love of God and then says if reaction does not take place even after continuous hearing and chanting of the Holy Name Of The Lord it may be considered to be due to offenses only that is the opinion of the sarbas Jami says that in the beginning of the chanting of the Holy Name Of The Lord if the devote has not been very careful about avoiding the 10 kinds of offenses at the feet of the Holy Name certainly the reaction of the feeling of separation will not be visible by Tears in the eyes and standing of the end on end so and then so the eight symptoms of ecstasy you heard about as you know hair standing on end and tears swelling up in the eyes and body trembling Breathing heavily and perspiring and body the color changing like that there are eight symptoms so these eight symptoms are external but one has to manifest the nine other symptoms of Baba also that should accompany this otherwise the sahas cheat others by making a pretention of power and then they're doing all illicit things and all so therefore he says that you have to follow the four reg principles and chant the holy name and sometimes will manifest so one test has given all of us all of you say gaang said when you say what should happen so your body should tremble not due to winter cold but due to ecstasy and all of you say hurry hurry so check whether there are Tears In Your Eyes that's second test by saying har har tears are not there by saying gaang is not standing on end that means we have committed this is a test very simple test so because it's a easy test immediate test correct so I was actually planning to speak on the 10 offenses briefly about all the 10 offenses maybe half hour 40 minutes yeah so you know the the 10 offenses everybody resides every day at the same time if we recite the 10 offenses unconsciously or UNM mindfully then we don't get much benefit you all know this means to accept AA means not accept so uh the Consciousness is very important to bring in all the activities why am I doing what what I doing to the degree we bringing mind and Consciousness with us you know then the forward March immediately happens one example let me tell you an example it becomes clear once Jamar got two men and ask them what is your skill one fellow said I can dig very well another fellow said I can fill up very well so two experts he got so he he said I have a thousand plans so tomorrow you come at 10:00 and we'll all go to the garden and he told the two fellows that you have ability to dig very quickly and then I can put the plant and then he can fill up correct now in this way let us plant thousand plants in one day we'll finish it J said they agreed so next morning they came at 10 but jar was busy with something so 12:00 he went to the garden and both the fellows asked him sir give us our wages we are going now they said but he said but I told that you have to dig and we have to put the plant he said no he already dug and I already filled up our our job is over now he give us our salary we are going now he said said do you remember why I told you you have to D you have to dig the ground they said I only know to dig I don't hear anything else so this is called unconscious hearing because these two fools didn't know the purpose of digging and filling is for placing the plants they didn't hear that you understand know so therefore many times we hear half information and then we commit mistake because of that see machines are unconscious we can't afford to be like machines the other day I was sitting in a car behind there was one more devote there was a space crunch so I picked up the you know laptop and put it in the front seat as soon as I put immed sound started coming because the car thought that somebody sitting in the front seat for putting yeah putting this because it's a blind machine for him whether your body weight or laptop weight makes no difference it's all the same for it you put some weight in the front so immedately because unconscious machine he cannot distinguish between what is matter what is spirit it's designed just to blindly behave it's blind machine then the driver what he did he put the belt behind the laptop and then he put the button and it kept quiet that another blindness sometime human beings also do that now some people don't like the belt here they put the belt here they think they are thinking they're very smart but when there's an accident their face will smash on the window smash on the glass so one should know why this principles are kept why the seat belt is kept it is for your safety it is kept not that you put it behind and think now I intelligent now such intelligence also another type of unconsciousness like two friends were going in a bike only one helmet they had the other asked he asked other hey do you have a helmet he said no police doesn't come in that road what is the meaning of that are you wearing helmet for police or are you wearing for your safety H see those who behave like this they are the ones who will do nag you will see in spiritual life also huh you know you can make 15 course feast and eat say that you know I didn't eat grains today okay you didn't eat grains but you ate such a feast and you slept you didn't do anything spiritual so this I'm speaking on this because our pretentious devotional service is the cause of offenses pretentious devotion service so the more we pretend and do drama just like our put did drama devotional service what was a drama she did yeah she pretended to be like a mother but her intention was to kill similarly we may try to practice externally the limbs of devotion service but her intentions may be different many times like for example charam charam supposed to be drunk in the Consciousness that this is the foot wash of the Supreme Lord isn't it it is so pure imagine you drink four glasses of very nice give me more give me more then that reverence is lost correct now then you don't have the reference refence is finished then how can we be conscious that this is foot wash of Vish even if it is available you take only little on purpose you take a little so that you can meditate I'm not going to take more so that my mind will come to realize that this is foot wash of Vishnu isn't it so at every moment from morning to night we have to repeatedly bring our mind to act consciously and not in a dead manner because if I going to keep my mind dead I will act instinctively if I'm going to be conscious I can think before I speak I can look before I leap your ability to look before you leap comes by conscious attempt not by a dead attempt so that dead attempt is what makes us commit one type of offense called as offense of omission there are two types of offenses offense of Omission offense of commission offense of omission was done by a few people like Indra once was given a Garland byas and then he took the G gave it to the elephant and the dull elephant you know he put it under the ground and put it on the ground and he crushed it that was the dangerous thing that happened duras cursed him so he lost all his kingdom op everything because he gave it to a dull creature that was a mistake so in this way he was little careless in how to deal with the garland a Garland offered to L should be very carefully dealt with similarly when austa Rishi came with his disciples indraa was doing meditation but he didn't offer proper guest reception so because of that omission of respect he was caused to become an elephant in the next life you may wonder he didn't do anything still he got a curse now that is called offense of omission he was supposed to offer respect he failed to offer respect he de said if sasi comes into the temple or a guru comes you don't offer obces the whole day you have to fast it is said I was still speaking thisn ticket one boy became frightened he said whoever comes the temple for obces he said I asked why I cannot fast full day why these rules are kept for that purpose only because people will do anything in the world except fasting so so it's a very dangerous thing so better offer and take prad you don't have to fast so the idea is offense of omission should be avoided and offense of another example Indra is sitting with his wife sa on the throne and showered with flowers and devatas are all worshiping him praising him band The playing is going on in the palace and then brhaspati Guru is coming every day he would come huh and then Indra was seeing every day and offering obasan sometimes such obasan offering can become a routine he did and did and did every day and today he saw the guru coming he took him very lightly in the 10th C there is one verse it says you know vicinity is the cause of disrespect what is the vinity when somebody we are closely associated repeatedly and they're easily available to us we can commit offenses to them another another means disrespect you can so every day Wasing OB he thought okay one day if we don't offer what difference it makes and then the guru vanished quickly he realized Indra C from his seat put his Garland and everything and then he told all his associates I committed offense to Guru now immediately I'll go to his house and fall at his feet and beg forgiveness so that you know I will not be cursed by Guru so he went immediately rushed to his house but his Guru was not there why on purpose his Guru thought that I don't want to forgive this fellow so quickly he has to underg some trouble solid kicks he has to get and learn lessons after that only he will come to his senses thinking like this brhaspati hid himself somewhere see you cannot hide yourself anywhere from persons like Indra because these people have lot of Mystic Powers anywhere you hide they can find out people like Indra Brahma Davi they all have a lot of powers but Guru was more powerful than him so he could hide himself and still not reveal the place where he hiding can you imagine so again he lost all his offences that time so in this way offense of commission this is offense of omission again because he he was careless to offer respects and offense of commission means like d prajapati you know he spoke very badly about Lord Shiva in a public assembly off of commission gopal chapal goal CH goal goal CH didn't speak but he kept some dur Puja paraphernalia and everything and to assassinate the character of Great Soul Shas and gopal chakti he offended haras takur that's another takur said that namas itself is enough to offer us Liberation he became very angry with him and he started criticizing him he said if what you are saying is not true your nose will fall in three days something like that he said so immediately ma majar who are the organizers of of the program they became very angry they said hey we have invited this great soul haridas takur for this event and he glorified the holy name so beautifully and uh you are appointed as a superintendent in our estate and you are talking such ill words at the Great Soul you have spoiled the whole show today h get out of here they chastised him but after 3 days nothing happened this fellow's no he melted because of offense uh so in this way he he committed offense by verbally like d also verb right now shingi also committed verbal offense saari also committed verbal offense to guda like that these are all verbal offenses so we may commit mental offense also like when mukunda took gadar pit to he committed a mental offense thinking of him to be a like that we may commit a mental offense also we not speak it but we may think in the mind something wrong wrong about somebody and judge somebody that's a mental offense there a physical offense like to Brahma he committed What offense mental off to sha verbal offense and Vish physical off he kick him on the chest isn't it physical offense yeah so this way we we may we may commit offenses to devotes to make it easy for us to remember the first offense you can remember two formula I'll will tell you very easy to remember plus formula can remember PL us so P stands for previous to coming to Krishna Consciousness if any devote had any shortcoming one should not talk about that like imagine one of your friend now has become Advanced devot somebody's praising him such a wonderful devote you say I know him in our village in school days you were smoking cigarette one should not say like that even if you was smoking before don't talk bad things about his bad past you should forget about that from your mind something good you can say about him say otherwise don't say anything previous to commit Krishna Consciousness and yell for L traces of some lingering things like for example some still angry somebody seems to be a little competitive in book scores or something like that sometimes you look at devotees like when gang pru came to Pune you know they were announcing the book score of all the brahmacharis one score was announced so distributed 21 books and that fellow sitting behind he pushed through the crowd and came and he shook the shoulder of the announcer he said hey that was not 21 that is 71 he said because two 21 and 71 look similar now while writing they committed some mistake then afterwards some devotees felt very bad about it why is he so frive you know coming from behind pushing everybody you know you know even if he the announcer is saying 21 the date is no what is the score what do they not correct isn't it so they came and asked me I thought anyway gang is there we can check with them when I asked G what do you feel about this devotes are upset with that fellow said why should devotees be upset earlier that fellow must have been counting cricket scores now he's counting book scores later on he will stop counting scores he was telling in this way devotees are improving correct now don't critize at least they are coming coming and doing some service see if is doing service and his little fru no problem he's better than those who don't do any service at all you know later on the mentality will also go away so uh last traces of such Tendencies and then you for unpremeditated fall down sometimes it is seen that people become weak sometimes in Krishna Consciousness the one one counselor was telling me his counseling didn't come to meeting for two months the counselor would call and the councel would cut the phone and not pick up the couple so one day suddenly counselor prau and his wife when they went to Market they went to his house directly and the door was slightly open so they just pushed the door and went in very casually and that fellow was sitting in the sofa and watching TV full blast TV was going on at home as soon as councelor entered he jumped up and he was searching for the what do you call it remote and he couldn't find it he was shouting at the sun better where is the remote I'm not find it not finding the remote he took a blanket and threw over the TV but from from inside the blanket sound is still coming then he was telling pru let us go to another room my my children are watching TV I think it's very noisy Place let's go to another room counselor understood everything he was just laughing Andy I told the counselor you could have given me a call at least before for coming counselor said I just came to Market just like that and I remembered your house is nearby I thought I'll visit and go councelor didn't say one word why you didn't come for the meeting two months he didn't put a gun point or something he just told him I just casually came to see you how you are doing prau after that subsequent week onward he started attending regularly meeting this example of unpremeditated fall down C clearly understood that this fellow is watching TV is indication of his spiritual weakness but sometimes s people feel pained if you point out the weakness correct now yeah but you have to go and give them support not destroy them not discourage them but try to develop them by meeting them personally and pting them okay it happens sometimes becomes a little weak similarly somebody didn't come to Temple for four months and then a person is coming to Temple everybody's looking him from a distance like a seeing animal in a Zoo like that and imagine allas on one side and he's alone on the other side as if he has committed the biggest blunder in the universe and some people who are not very sensitive go ask that is even more worse also so unpremeditated lips must be forgiven unless you go to give him some prad Pat him as if nothing has happened then he's likely to come back correct and the fourth one is yes is social background some may look black or some's body may be fat some may be extremely thin as if you blow they'll fly off some people have seen they're tall and thin only bones are in their body some are like that and some are extremely plumpy they will be obese like that some somebody is black or somebody has all white hair on the head somebody has some in in the skin some some kind of disease or something like that so one should not see these things or one should not see somebody is born in a lower family higher family is a ver from thees he says in one side of Ganga your dead body is floating other side of the ganga somebody is moving the waters and then doing aaman because ganga can never be polluted whatever things people put in ganga it's always pure similarly vna's body may look to be having some deformity and all those things disease or something butn should be judged by the heart not by the body like a vas has a huge aing body but his heart is like a tender know Lotus flow from his prayers you can [Music] see Maharani she's a queen she's a very tender woman compare both these people both are she's aavi he a you can see that in both their hearts resides loving affection and attraction and respect for Krishna so one should learn to see the substance of Krishna Consciousness in the hearts of the Jas and not go by the externals saw that old lady the spark of in her heart saw in the sou Indian Brahman also so mahu was able to see that mahu saw even in the heart of tigers and deers and elephants also in jarand isn't it what to speak of humans so don't see the social background like when uh when brahmachari parents came to Pune so the brahmachari took them to one house where you know they they were speaking the same language that's what we do generally if somebody is from Punjab send them to punjabi's homes somebody is from Tel then we send them to Telo homes so that they'll feel very comfortable so parents are very happy oh they speak our language they very comfortable then they took Prasad they saw the Altar and father mother were impressed they said what a big altar they have and how nicely they worship they very very devout people they have two three children also still they are so dedicated so on the way back father casually asked are they brahmans like that he asked and this brahmachari told their cast and and they were lower cast immediately father became wild he told the guard to stop immediately became angry on the son he said what have you done you have taken us and fed lunch in the home of somebody who is from a NTI and the son said no no noas they're better than brahans like that he said because is better than this says if you take a thousand brahmans who know Vedas better than those thousand brahans is one who is learned in vedanta and one thousands of brahans who know V better than such a person is a vishaka it says so he told Papa don't see their cast there vnas he said but father couldn't understand because he was not a devote how many of understand this example understand this yeah so father was seeing from a jati Budd point of view where a son was seeing fromn point of view but I told this boy that next time you take him to somebody who is also Brahman so father will be pacified was brah birth also so but at least we should not be like that that type of attitude we should not have social background we should not see so this is plus formul you all will remember P for yeah previous to coming to yeah and then L yeah L traces of some anas showing up anger greed and all that and then you and yes yeah social so the because these are the four ways we tend to commit offenses so we can carefully avoid these things and what are the offenses there is one panic verse which talks about the five type of offenses it talks very easy to remember j k e b a can remember joke bad J stands for not feeling Joy upon seeing a like morning M come and you see one don't think like that morning time I have to look at his face don't think like that because some of you we will see that sometimes you have affection for somebody aversion for somebody correct no so that Aion is not very good the a feeling in the heart that produces offenses you don't like to see that face therefore we have to clear any kind of displeasure or some bitterness in relationship so that when you look at them you don't feel uneasy or unhappy even if you have difference in opinion with othera you can think that that VNA is like that and I am like this no problem everybody Krishna has made all of us differently just like look at the flowers every flower is different you know every VNA is different some flower is small some is Big some are fragrant some are beautiful everyn is like a flower don't try to put everybody in one box and say all VN should be like this only don't say that one time in Pune somebody came and spoke in the bhagam class that you know Leela is all useless one should speak t t is the most important thing the whole bham class was all this only this is the main point there was one sin Edward sitting behind and he was really really very unhappy with the class and then he came and asked me am I allowed to give bachar class today he asked me I said yeah you a senior man can give so then in the brahmachari class he spoke all about how Leela is important you and then he C defeated all the morning points what was spoken but he did not know that the morning speaker was sitting behind he heard everything then he made notes the next day morning again he spoke so then again this devote came to me and said one more class can I give I said you don't give one more class I will give class today so then I went to brah class and brought about a balance which is important both are important somebody asking should I eat food or drink water which one both areed you have to eat food drink water you Cann do either of the not either both are so now this devey develop little bitterness towards that devey because party party so give up this kind of mentality because then you cannot feel Joy in your heart when you see the devotees you have to see everybody's like like chra mahaj was telling somebody came and told mahaj I came to new vavan that VNA who is very tall and very very built well built body you know he is very aggressive devote mahaj he very passionate and very pushy fellow he makes lot of demand mahaj said and said he said he said yeah he gets things done you don't know how many big projects He has done and mahaj said when I saw him first time he came towards me I was also afraid because his body was very big he walked towards me like this and then he folded said then he thought thank you that's all nothing else I thought he going to crush me or something externally he looked like that but he's a simple devote so in this way mahaj was telling that I mean we should not hold any kind of males towards any any devote it's not very good because if you have males we cannot feel Joy when we see them the main reason for males is we are very rigid and we are very clothed we are like a kand like a frog in the well we think everybody has to fit within my box of my own understanding we don't understand vnas are of different varieties just like birds are different varieties flowers are of different varieties there are different types of vnas so we have to accommodate and Krishna has created many many vnas very uniquely so therefore feel Joy upon seeing vnas that vnas are rare commodity in this world you know there are 8 billion population in this world but vnas are few who are willing to come to Temple bow down to God chant the Holy Name ready the scriptures lead a clean Pure Life and keeping Krishna in their hearts so the more we understand the Rarity of a VNA which CH spoke to rup Swami inash you know you will Cry tears to offend anyn becauseas are very very rare actually we should worship the feet of the vnas in our heart what to speak of offending them sometimes may be in shuru position you may chasti somebody or correct somebody that is also another form of affection like a mother pinching a child or scolding a child is also for the benefit of the child but there should be no hatred mother father cannot have Envy for the child like Envy for that is unacceptable so if you guiding somebody a senior cannot have Envy for a junior or you cannot have eny for equal also if have Envy we cannot feel Joy when we see them in my life I made up my mind I will be like a I won't have any enemies I keep my doors always open if they want they consider me that enemy that is whose problem that problem I have not a single devote on the planet to whom I will say that if I see him I will not talk to him I don't want to talk people go I will never do that to anybody even with those with who have had terrible times between me and him because he did some mischief and I caught him and I punished him also even if they come we will never turn our face you should not have Because unless you clear your equation with all Jas you cannot go back to godhead so we should not keep anything in our mind so that is j o for not offering obasan to your vnav because we think why sometime people think should I offer obas first or after he gives me OB then I'll give some people think like that correct no sometime they may be equal so we are wondering he's not senior to me why should I give obces as if OB are rare commodity like spending a lak rupees or something see even if you give OB say somebody younger you will not lose anything so one example I'll tell you Bak was staying in Bak the hospital fifth floor along with mad prau who is in gokulam now correct now both of them five years they were together and they were doing lot of services in Bak hospital he was like a spiritual counselor there and mad preaching in colleges and all mad was telling us once every single day morning after taking bath and mahaj will see him first he will offer obces he also would offer OB he was saying we staying in the same room only two of us were staying and I never expected that we have to offer a to each other we are you know we just like friends so but he offered I also gave and he said in this five years not a single day passed without offering a so he was very Amazed by that so same thing is as Maharaj and his old Mahan Maharaj they both were studying Hindi in masuri there is a place for about three months they studied Hindi to no basic Hindi they were staying together so mahaj servant was telling every single day morning after bathing when they would see each other they would offer vies first thing because Chan mahu you will see also you know how he deals with vnas is very very examplary you will see that when the Bengali vnas are coming the Mah pru you know go offers obasan to them then puts chandan then puts Gan sometimes these rituals May slowly become forgotten and we may ignore them so somebody's respectable and not offering obas that becomes a offense also yeah and uh third one is K killing aishna oh that's very terrible I don't think anybody will do that you knowas tried to kill see isn't it any other example some to kill Shing par to die y prash tried to kill ran when was a student yeah he thought he'll become a great exponent later correct J was made attemp by the Yeah so like that there are many examples killing of is like a brah terrible off we don't have to worry too much about it we have to especially worry about first one not feeling Joy because some after I gave one class Onna many people caught me and said how to feel Joy please tell us I am having some problem with that fellow you know can I change the temple go to another Temple I said he may move to another Temple but still you'll remember that fellow unless you remove the th because this fellow gave feedback to that fellow and that fellow gave bigger feedback to this fellow so they both became big enemies I told him see you committed the first mistake you gave him small feedback he gave small feedback he gave big F feedback you know so I said you gave a small slab he gave a bigger slab what to do you could avoid the first slap I told him then he felt a little more nice I think the mistake was from my side I began first then I told him you are not his spiritual Guardian but you became a self-appointed adviser and went and gave him feedback therefore he gave me gave you back so why are you feeling bad about him I said then he became little relieved now I feel he's a good person because till now he has never done this with me the first time he's doing because some we pinch somebody and then they pinch us why are you pinching that's what aasa did correct aasa he going into mavan with his wide open mouth and with eyes is blinking at Krishna and covered boys he says this is the same blue boy who killed my sister baky and my brother Baka I will not leave him I will give tangali to them by swallowing this boy and all his friends so see he is saying that this is the fellow who killed my brother and sister is saying but is brother and sister Krishna didn't go to Mata to kill them they came to and what trouble they created like put gave him milk mixed with poison and Baka even swallowed him therefore Krishna killed them that he's not telling he only telling he killed my brother and sister so he is not able to see his mistake I mean his brother sister's mistake he is only thinking krishna's mistake many of us we commit mistakes first and we blame others later on so therefore feeling Joy upon seeing offering obas to vnav you know and also k e stands for envying a vnaa gopal chapal was envying there is in Maharashtra there is in tukaram tukaram was a very very pure devote and very nice singer of poems on glorification of Lord V thousands of poems he wrote became very popular people would be singing in the fields singing in their homes everywhere people be singing tukaram song so there was one another fellow salal he became very envious salal is ignoramus a foolish fellow but he wanted to become popular like so what he did one day he called his servant and said I will dictate one po not down so he dictated a eight eight line or 10 line poem and then like that he said at the end you know and that servant was noting down said this poem is well known at the last line it say and saying he said who told you this PO how do you know it it's my creation you know you put my name in this and send it to everybody so all the people are singing toar song should sing ah my song now you see especially this competition comes where like preachers may talk ill of other preachers book distributors may talk ill of other ma who may be good Cooks they may say she may be a good cook but not like me I can do something better our Garland makers can critize other Garland makers or singers huh you know sometimes singers perform with their team of and harmonium and everything powerful and among there are also other powerful singer teams so you go and ask them how do you feel about the other team so that's where the competition comes so here is a secret Open Secret I have told you make it a point if you are good in one field even before any problem can come into your mind you you create a natural method of always praising those in the same field like like I am a preacher now I should naturally praise amra or Gan all these people you you create a natural very healthy State of Mind for them made them discuss with them learn and share and praise them always don't criticize you if you have a habit of criticizing subtly subtly or grossly either in a public class or privately gradually the offensive propensity will enter like you can see your uh there's a very great book famous distributor called Vijay prau in Los Angeles and there pru in isv now California similarly there NAU sometime is in mayapur sometimes in America these are all big book distributors they all love each other so much if you just one word you ask na about viau or two hours he will speak to you so much appreciation he has he says I nothing and he such a great Soul he will say and also there is bti in La also you knowu can distribute big big bulk of sets in just 30 seconds he can convince people to take he's close to 75 or something he looks like a young boy H very very powerful disributor all these book distributors they have deep respect and appreciation for each other I've never seen them ever criticize anyone so this Isn actually so especially in your own field what others like like you are going for youth preaching so you are a youth preacher somebody else is youth preacher you should honestly appreciate what what they are doing rather than say that he cannot do this I can't do this if you are very eager to boast about yourself and then you want people to look at you and pray nobody will pra they will know that he's envious so if you're EnV so that therefore envying Ofna is very dangerous that really contaminates the Consciousness and it's like a diseased State of Consciousness we will also suffer and we will make others also suffer M like when prad preached abroad and brought some Western disciples to India and he had no place to keep the disciples so he kept them in some Matas and then propad was moving around finding out facility meanwhile some of his God Brothers had told the devotees that this Swami Maharaj you he was a businessman in alad had a business he's a simple gasta and you can see many of us we are all sasis you know and he is not very knowledgeable well if you really want proper Gaia V Sant you want to understand you should hear from these senior sasi disciples ofak and they started poisoning them so then when prad came to the mat bag some of the disciples started asking who are more senior to you and and said yes Bak mahaj is a great soul in Sanskrit and he's my senior god brother I adore him and Bak mahaj relationship with prop was very very sweet they both had very very good relationship but there were other fellows there were also good God brothers who adored prad's good work like when prad came to India he went to B Mah's Ma and it was in the rooftop mahaj was sitting and prad went and met him she embraced him and mahaj what have you done amazing work you have fulfilled the desire of our spiritual Master by going to America and preaching an English language and you brought these two boys with you who are sasis now so he saw kitan Swami and a Swami both were in Saffron dress he patted both the boys and said you two boys you you know in India you go and preach people have so much respect for Americans you are going to make thousands of devotees in India and those two boys are new to India totally they saw Bak mahaj eyes were glistening in great affection for Swami Maharaj and prad was telling these two devotees that actually is far more learned than me he's vastly learned in Sanskrit therefore B gave him the name bakti Rak protector guardian of biti he has given him even I take inspiration from him prad said so prad was humbling himself in front of him and he was adoring pra's good work abroad he said we none of us could do and you could do it great thing you did and then pra was talking to him late at night and then next day morning when mangar happened they going for for at 7:00 so all the disciples youngsters brahmacharis they were going ahead so Bak mahaj called our prad and they both sat in AA they both go went together because he had this arthritis problem in the KN he cannot walk easily but they both sat in the and they want to see the beauty of so they also went and The Disciples of prad was very touched here is example of a non- envious vnav correct now on the other hand that were people like the what I told you some of them try to make sure that PR cannot get a land in mayapur you know saw that some people are envious so why people are envious because they're afraid that this VNA will get ahead of me then we should be given up and then j k b for blaspheming ofn the BL actually how blasphemy comes initially it is Fault finding see when you dislike someone you find false when you hate someone you do blasphemy so dislike is in the mind hate is in the heart what the difference between mind and heart heart is subconscious mind we call it mind is M so when you have a little dislike for someone that is the preliminary step of apar at that stage only we can root it out you should remove it if you don't remove it eventually it will turn into hat thre so one should not blasphemy blasphemy comes with the mouth speaking bad things about somebody one of the things lessons I learned in my life there may be some vnaa who is not proper but why should I worry about him his spiritual Guardian will guide him for for example you go to a hospital somebody has cancer somebody has you know brain tumor do you have to worry about everybody all the patients sitting outside who will worry about them doctor doctor has a record also and he will deal with them you mind your own business whatever purpose for which you went to hospital you get your disease cured similarly you are in a temple or a community you don't worry about everybody because you are not their Mentor spiritual guardian or something so they will start out that problem themselves once my S master was telling if somebody has a problem you are watching it what to do he said wait and watch he said because somebody else will give feedback and he may correct it you don't have to rush to immediately give the feedback and or you can give a feedback to the spiritual Guardian who is guiding them then they can guide just like if you catch a pick pocket in the station you hand him over to police you don't slap him beat him in case you slap him fell in the ground and died then people will beat you up you just hand over to in charge somebody so that is b and a for becoming angry on AA all of us have how many of you experience becoming angry some slowly Rising i r we all become angry sometime or you may not become angry every day but in some occasion or other when your values are tested somebody like for example I am conservative or strict somebody's liberal then I'll become angry correct now like I am quick to do things somebody is slow I'll become angry say I'm responsible somebody is very responsible even after 20 calls are made doesn't lift when you go on personally meet him he says oh you called me I didn't see it very some people are very cool and some people they speak lies very very effortlessly in one sentence they'll say four lies like so you really get upset become angry with some people but one has to control the anger because anger is like fire it's very dangerous see every one of our senses is preed by preing D correct no with the I there is Surya for the ears there is diatas for the nose there is ashin kumaras for the mouth who who knows AG so mouth just like AG if you put little more the will be burnt so if you speak little more then people will not forget for their life you gave some work to somebody and and you say one week ago he gave the work all this week you have been lazy like a buffalo and didn't complete the work so when you say like that one word they will hear very nicely and for whole life they will not forget it so we have to mind our words what we speak so that is angry okay and then D is for devote so J for Jo not feeling Joy upon seeing vnaa o for k e and B A and D devote towards the devote yeah so this is called this is from the there is one verse which says that this is spoken by our Sati to her father very very important ver it begins like this are you sh you can check that she says everything will be finished if you offend the devotes he says your aush your lifespan your opulences and your Fame and all your religiosity uh and all the blessings you received from different people everything if you offend great Souls all this will be finished she says so therefore we have to be very careful I'm devoting so much time only for the first offense because the first three offenses talk about haruru VNA first offense isna second offense is har third offence is Guru so those two are very very important one should one has to be very careful attentive dealing with you know this these three things yeah I'm going to conclude with because there are many things to do one one just one question is here prop says success is sure for a rigid practitioner and we are also strong in aspects like morning program Etc then how we can compromise or accept this in name of variety see when I'm talking about variety doesn't mean that some devote may like to attend morning program some may not like we are not saying like that everybody has especially if you are in the temple and if if you if you are staying in a student center voice Center if they not attending you don't have to become angry on them you can very politely and humbly tell them there is a flat available for you nearby you know we have found out for you and there is one G couple who will give da Prasad you can stay there and as for your will and wish whenever you want to come here you can come and he will immediately be shocked why am I asked to quit we are not asking to quit we are request to stay there instead of here if you want to stay here this is the standard so you can politely but firmly tell this is the standard but you don't have to tease them ridicule them yell at them like so even Corrections even a manager can behave properly correct no but sometimes the managers bu some pent of feelings for a while and later on it comes out in a ugly manner which leads to anger and blasphemy and all which we should avoid so don't get frightened about this topic this topic we are discussing because this uh first offense is very important uh so that if our chanting has to be good our mind has to be very peaceful because of all these different type of offenses I told you our mind loses its peace and then it it unnecessarily focuses on material vibrations instead of focusing on you know praying to Lord very joyfully and begging for shelter spiritual shelter yeah so uh if you have if you have any further questions you can write to me if you want you can my video manage there you can ask him for email he'll give you and you can write to me I'll respond otherwise if you take questions like that day another one hour will go so I think I can answer email to you okay\")]"

            "\n",
            "**Offense of omission** occurs when an action or respect is deliberately neglected, leading to negative consequences. Examples include Indra neglecting to properly receive a garland and failing to offer proper respect to a guest.\n",

            "\n",

Just as doctors handle patients' medical concerns, our spiritual guardian can guide us through life's difficulties. We should not worry about the problems of others or try to solve them ourselves. When faced with anger, we should allow it to arise but then let our spiritual guide handle it. The speaker compares this to catching a pickpocket and handing the criminal to the police rather than engaging in physical confrontation.\n",
            "\n",
            "The speech emphasizes the importance of controlling anger and carefully choosing words. It highlights the analogy of anger being like fire, which can be destructive if not managed.

In today’s world even expecting of peace and harmony is like a fools wish. People are fighting with each other, for a patch of land millions are killed, governments are wasting more money in production of weapons than in education and social welfare. People on high positions wants to exploit the people in lower positions and the people in lower positions are trying to pull the people above them down. Everyday number of women are raped, number of people are killed, number of crimes happen. When there is so much lust, anger and greed then how can we expect of peace and harmony. This is all because of narrow-mindness of the modern people. The concept of me and mine is so much into the minds of people from the beginning that they think everything is their’s and therefore, they are not afraid when they are violating another man’s rights. It normal to them, to kill, rape, intoxicate, fight etc. The present-day society is filled with so much chaos that even the animal kingdom is much safer than living among the humans.The actual nature of every living entity is spirit soul. That noted, nobody is a permanent resident of this world, for everyone belong to the spiritual world. When we are covered by ignorance, we understand this world to be our actual position and whatever we have here, as ours. This ignorance then give birth to attachment to the temporary things and people. We must admit that we are not here forever, and especially not together. Everyone must leave, the property, money in the bank account, cars, houses will all be left here. Just as one comes alone, he goes alone. This knowledge of men in covered by the ignorance which is like a dark night, where the soul is not able to properly see and is always in danger. Can you be in peace if you are not able to see anything?They say if you want to go fast, walk alone, but if you want to walk far, walk along. We as a community, need each other to grow. We need to appreciate each other’s contribution and ignore one another’s faults. Then we can talk about the long-gone harmony. The biggest diversion in this are pride and ego. Pride do not let one to consider other person valuable as the proud person if full of superiority complex. They think that they are the best in the world and therefore, they consider others insignificant. Whereas egoistic people can’t see others moving ahead than themselves, their ego does not ley them accept others and thus they start to envy them. When the egoistic people see someone becoming more than them, they are overcome by their anger and when this anger increases over the limit, they lose their control over themselves and the quarrel starts. This is not the case of any single person in this world, but of all. They, how can we expect of peace and harmony?God is proprietor of all and He instructs everyone about how to use His property. Therefore, He sent His message in various books and through various teachers. The man has awarded most developed intelligent in whole creation just to understand the message of God. Although this is the only duty of human kind, still leaving this they are indulged in sinful activities to gratify their senses. The Lord in Bhagavad Gita explains about the law of karma, which says, one gets the reaction to every committed action according to the nature of the action. If the action is pious there will be good reaction, if it is impious, the reaction is going to be miserable. As we see in the society, people are indulged in wrong activities only like – illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication, and gambling. Everybody is busy enjoying one’s senses and satisfying them which surely involves someone else’s pain and suffering in that; therefore, the peace and harmony are not here. In a society, where everyone is only self-conscious, how can there be peace and harmony.People were given broader intelligence by the grace of God but being detached from Him, they have become narrow minded. They have lost all compassion and empathy for each other. They don’t want to care for each other now. They think that they are not responsible for other person’s life, this shows that they have lost all of their moral values for the want of profit, money and personal gratification. This narrow-minded intelligence of human had made the path so narrow that only one person can move forward, and if some people want to go at the same time, then only one will go, over the dead bodies of others. Material attachment, ego, pride, sins and sense of proprietor-ship is all side-effects of bodily consciousness; therefore, we must come out of this self(bodily) consciousness to the level of self(soul) consciousness.A devotee of the Lord is in higher consciousness, he does not think anything as his property. The scriptures say this whole world is one family – Vasudha-eva-kutumbakam. Everyone is one family, family of God. The Lord also claims this in Bhagavad-gītā as – mamaiva-amsho-jiva-loke-jiva-bhuta-sanatana, that these spirit souls are His part and parcels and are same family. A devotee is mindful enough to use his awarded intelligence for God, he knows that Krishna is the father, the Earth is the mother and all of us, whether plant, animal, insects, birds or humans are children of them. Thus, every one of us has equal rights to the property of our father and it is our responsibility to help our brother and sisters to live a happy life. When there is some clash between the members of family, we do not respond by guns and bomb, we should consult and compromise because at last we are a family, a devotee thinks whole world as his family and therefore, he fights with nobody.Those who reject this fact and do not accept the supremacy and proprietorship of God are destined to be doomed. Once a snake named Kaliya, occupied the river Yamuna for himself. He was so venomous that by just his presence in the river the living beings started to die. The greenery around the back of river disappeared and if the cows ate the left-out grass, they would die. Kaliya was not the resident of the river but had taken shelter in the river. Gradually he started to understand that the river is his property because there was no one stronger than him to kick him out. Once the Lord, from Whom everything has come out went to play on the banks of the river. There He decided to swim in the waters of Yamuna; while swimming He met Kaliya; He ordered Kaliya to go away from the Vraja and Yamuna because he was causing very much damage to the living entities in the river and outside cows and cowherd people. The Kaliya was not able to identify the Lord as Supreme Personality of Godhead and did not agree to the advice. Later the Lord punished Kaliya by eliminating the toxic venom out of him by dancing over the heads of the snake. Those who consider the property of God as there are punished by the Lord in different ways, but the end is same – we are not the proprietor.Ravana was also trying to abduct Lord’s personal consort Sita for himself. He wanted to enjoy Her, thinking he can do anything he wants to do. At that time Ravana was the most powerful person in whole universe, even Lord Brahma and Siva were not able to kill him. He thought he cannot be killed, and therefore he understood himself and the master of all. Such materialistic men like Ravana are always planning to enjoy and exploit the God’s property but the Lord’s energy always destroy their plans to dust. He was soon killed by the Lord along with his whole race of demons. These sense-gratificatory fools are always busy in their destruction and those who follow them are also destroyed alongside. These fools are also present in present day world in the forms of some political leaders, businessmen, corrupt leaders etc. and if we are to follow them, we are going to face the same fate as Ravana did.Dhirtrashtra is another example in the list of bodily conscious people. The very first verse of Bhagavad-gītā talks about him asking about the position on the battlefield. He asks, “What are his sons and the sons of his brother Pandu are doing on the religious and pious battlefield of Kurukshetra.” If Dhritrashtra would have wanted, he could have stopped the war by rightfully returning the half of kingdom to the Pandavas, but he was so attached to his intellectually blind son that he could not disagree with him. He was to attached to his son and the kingdom that he was ready to face death of his sons on the battlefield rather than giving half the kingdom back and living happily with the half. Those who do not very much attached to the material possessions can even reject and try to kill the Lord, who is the only proprietor of everything, then what to speak of ordinary people with no power. Therefore, until there are people like this in this society peace and harmony is not possible. The only solution is to cultivate a sense of service towards God and then reflecting it towards everyone understanding that everyone is the part and parcel of God and that everything belongs to God.The concept of “me and mine” can at once be removed if just people accept the service attitude. We see from the history that the kings like Maharaja Yudhishthira, Rama and Parikshit were ruling the kingdom so well that even the demigods wanted to live under their reign. There was no chaos, everyone fulfilled their duties, there were nice crops, no droughts or floods. In the reign of the Lord Rama, there was no death for those who did not want it. Today, there are no leader who possess the power to stop death, opposite to that they are ready to even kill if it is profitable. Desires are natural but attachment to them blinds men to see the truth. The one quality we notice in the leaders mentioned above it that they were ready to leave everything at once, depicting that they are not at all attached to their position. The actions performed by the leader are followed by the followers, if the leader is takes care of the ruled, people will learn and follow his way. They always thought that everything is the property of God and they are given a task to take care on account of Him. Now, the leaders do not want to leave anything for anyone, we see some leaders in the political field are at the age of sixty to eighty and still they are not fed up by their position and power. When they are not interested in renouncing, why would the general population should do? Therefore, to ensure the peace and harmony in the nation, if the leader is God conscious then the whole nation can be directed towards that peace and harmony. Peace is simple, simplicity is peace, therefore, scriptures prescribe simple living and high thinking, instead of high living and simple thinking. We should try to acquire qualities like self-awareness, detachment, service to others, simple living and respecting all other beings. One can attain all other qualities by just practicing devotional service to the Lord and becoming the devotee of the Lord; by becoming God conscious one can bring peace and harmony in the society.\\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike Loading…\\n\\n\\nLeave a comment Cancel reply\\n\\n\\n\\nΔ \\n\\n\\n←Previous: We Live On\\xa0Mercy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLet’s connect\\n\\n\\nMail\\nTumblr\\nMedium\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJoin the fun!\\nStay updated with our latest tutorials and ideas by joining our newsletter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tType your email…\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t→\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRecent posts\\n\\n\\nIn want of\\xa0Peace\\n\\n\\nWe Live On\\xa0Mercy\\n\\n\\nA Devotee is\\xa0Bhagavan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrīti Lakṣaṇam\\nBlog PostsShort Lessons\\n\\n\\nDesigned with WordPress\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Comment\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReblog\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribed\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPrīti Lakṣaṇam\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSign me up\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAlready have a WordPress.com account?
